- 👋 Hi, I’m Ahmed
- 👀 I’m interested in picking up as much knowledge as I can with regards to development and data/ML/AI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust. Have mainly used Python (std, Flask, Odoo, Pandas etc...), VB.NET, HTML, CSS and some SQL up to this point.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data, ML, AI, CAE, automation projects, and anything Rust.
